## Deep Dive into a Recipe Management API with Laravel

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the Recipe Management API project:

**Data Model:**

- **Recipes:** 
    - Name
    - Description
    - Ingredients (a list of objects with name, quantity, unit)

    - Images (URL links or stored files)
    - Author (foreign key to a User table)
    - Creation and update timestamps
- **Users:**
    - Name
    - Email
    - Password (hashed)
    - API token (for authentication)
    - Collection of saved recipes (foreign key relationship)

**CRUD Operations:**

- **Create:** Users can submit new recipes with all the aforementioned details.
- **Read:**

**File Handling:**

- Store recipe images using Laravel's storage system or a dedicated cloud storage service like S3.

- Optionally, allow users to upload recipe files (e.g., PDFs) for detailed instructions or additional information.

**Authentication:**

- Implement Laravel's built-in authentication system with email and password login.
